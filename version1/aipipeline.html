      * the Image Chain * 
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the first image gets uploaded, its geo-location will be used to connect to the geo-position of the SCA-1 satellite with the center of Earth at the time of the upload. In the meantime, satellite images at both the upload position and the position of the SCA-1 satellite will be captured and shown, together forming a first image triangle.     
      <br>
      <br>
      When a new image gets uploaded, the “center of the Earth” will be replaced with the new center position between the previous image, previous SCA-1 position, the new image, and the new SCA-1 satellite position, creating a chain of interconnected triangles. The image chain will grow as new image gets uploaded while the “center” of the chain shifts. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It creates a recursive triangular system that replaces the center of Earth (a symbolic anchor of planetary balance) with the latest uploaded image’s location. It is a process of creating an alternative planetary map where local contributions continuously shift the focus of the planetary map.
