    Each time you upload an image, you will give us the following data:
    <br>
    <br>
  </h1>

    <ul  class="info-list">
        <li>date and time of the moment you upload your photo </li>
        <li>geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of your location at each image upload (we do not document your IP address) </li>
    </ul>

  <p  class="info-exchange">
    &nbsp&nbsp → in exchange you will see a satellite image (with the Google Earth Engine dataset) captured on the same day and time, 
    <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp from the same geo-location where you upload your image, with a radius of 10km bounding box; 
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp → in exchange you will see the satellite image of the land SCA-1 flies across at the same day and time
    <br>
  </p>

  <h1 class="data">
    Each uploaded image will produce the following data: 
    <br>
    <br>
  </h1>

    <ul  class="data-list">
        <li>each image will be assigned a unique content identifier (CID) as it is uploaded to and stored on IPFS; </li>
        <li>text description of each uploaded image and the two satellite images, recognized and classified by image recognition models  </li>
    </ul>

  <p  class="data-exchange">
    &nbsp&nbsp → in exchange you will know what land imagery SCA-1 hovers over at the same moment when you produce your image,  
    <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and how far away you are from the SCA-1 satellite; 
    <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp → in exchange you will find out when the SCA-1 flies across any energy facilities (according to energy facility and climate change database) 
    <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and how far away you are from such facility.

    * All metadata will be displayed on this website viewable by the public for research purposes of this project; 
    <br>&nbsp we do not conceal any other data or use any of the metadata for commercial, state-associated, or any other exchanges.
